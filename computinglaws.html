        <h3>Moore's Law</h3>
        <p>
          The numbers of transistors which manufacturers are able to miniaturize
          and place on a standard chip doubles approximately every 18 to 24
          months. Moore first made the observation in 1965, and his observation
          has held true to this day. In 1965 computers had thousands of
          transistors, today each computer chip contains billions of
          transistors.

        <h3>Kryder's Law</h3>
        <p>
          The number of storage sites on media increases by 10x every 18 months.
          Manufactures have been able to increase Hard-drives to allow them to
          hold more information. Smaller size and bigger capacity. "Today the
          density of information we can get on a hard drive is much more
          important to enabling new applications than advances in
          semiconductors." Kryder

        <!-- Butter -->
        <h3>Butter’s Law of Photonics</h3>
        <p>
          The amount of data coming out of an optical fiber is doubling every
          nine months. The cost of transmitting a bit over an optical network
          decreases by half every nine months. Companies aren't able to install
          new fiber optic fast enough to keep up the acceleration of Butter's
          law. Despite this, wired connections have seen a steady increase in
          transmission speeds and capacities.

        <p>
          The number of wireless signals that can simultaneously be transmitted
          without interfering with each other has been doubling approximately
          every 30 months since the early 1900s.

          Wirth's law is an adage on computer performance which states that
          software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming
          faster

        <h3>Reed's Law</h3>
        <p>
          Reed's law is the assertion of David P. Reed that the utility of large
          networks, particularly social networks, can scale exponentially with
          the size of the network. The reason for this is that the number of
          possible sub-groups of network participants is 2ᴺ − N − 1, where N is
          the number of participants
