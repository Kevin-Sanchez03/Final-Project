        <h3>Gottfried Leibnz</h3>
        <p>
          Leibniz may have been the first computer scientist and information
          theorist. Early in life, he documented the binary numeral system (base
          2), then revisited that system throughout his career.

        <h3>Analog Computers</h3>
        <p>
          An analog computer or analogue computer is a type of computer that
          uses the continuous variation aspect of physical phenomena such as
          electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities to model the problem
          being solved.

        <h3>Grace Hopper</h3>
        <p>
          Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was a computer pioneer and naval officer.
          She received a master’s degree (1930) and a Ph.D. (1934) in
          mathematics from Yale. One of the first three modern “programmers,”
          Hopper is best known for her trailblazing contributions to the
          development of computer languages. She Discovered the first computer
          bug and coined the word "debugging".

        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <p>
          In computer programming, assembly language (or assembler language,[1]
          or symbolic machine code[2][3][4]), often referred to simply as
          Assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level
          programming language with a very strong correspondence between the
          instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code
          instructions.

        <p>
          Nature tends to prefer quaternary computations, we use binary. binary
          doesn't convert well to other bases.

        <h3>Fluidic computers</h3>
        <p>
          Fluidics, or fluidic logic, is the use of a fluid to perform analog or
          digital operations similar to those performed with electronics.The
          physical basis of fluidics is pneumatics and hydraulics, based on the
          theoretical foundation of fluid dynamics.

        <h3>Machine learning</h3>
        <p>
          Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and
          computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to
          imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
