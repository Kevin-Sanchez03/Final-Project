        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          From 1939 to 1944 Aiken, in collaboration with IBM, developed his
          first fully functional computer, known as the Harvard Mark I. The
          machine, like Babbage's, was huge: more than 50 feet (15 metres) long,
          weighing five tons, and consisting of about 750,000 separate parts, it
          was mostly mechanical.

          <h4>Timeline</h4>
          <p>
            I made a timeline page showcasing the history of computers. It will
            show how computers have changed with each decade that passed. From
            the first computer up until the newest one.

          <h4>Laws of Computing</h4>
          <p>
            This page has some information about the laws of computing. They are
            eponymous laws, which means that the person who made the
            discovery/observation named it after themselves.
