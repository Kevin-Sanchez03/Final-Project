        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I made this website to talk about the history of computers. Humans
          have made a lot of advancements in a short amount of time.

          <h4>Timeline</h4>
          <p>
            I made a timeline page showcasing the history of computers. It will
            show how computers have changed with each decade that passed. From
            the first computer up until the newest one.

          <h4>Laws of Computing</h4>
          <p>
            This page has some information about the laws of computing. They are
            eponymous laws, which means that the person who made the
            discovery/observation named it after themselves.
