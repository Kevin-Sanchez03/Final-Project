        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I made this website to talk about the history of computers. This is an
          assignment for my intro to web development class, but i will probably
          work on this and update it after the class ends. This will be an
          ongoing project in order to practice, so feedback is greatly
          appreciated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The human race has made astounding technological progress in a short
          amount of time, it's an exponential grow. I want to highlight the big
          milestones that have made in the past.

          <h4>Timeline</h4>
          <p>
            I made a timeline page showcasing the history of computers. It will
            show how computers have changed with each decade that passed. From
            the first computer up until the newest one.

          <h4>Laws of Computing</h4>
          <p>
            This page has some information about the laws of computing. They are
            eponymous laws, which means that the person who made the
            discovery/observation named it after themselves.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Miscellaneous Info</h4>
          <p>
            On this page i added some information that doesn't fit into any
            specific category. It does still relate to computers in some way,
            however.
