              The Antikythera mechanism is an Ancient Greek hand-powered orrery,
              described as the oldest known example of an analogue computer used
              to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance.

            <p>
              The abacus, also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool
              which has been used since ancient times. It was used in the
              ancient Near East, Europe, China, and Russia, millennia before the
              adoption of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. The exact origin of
              the abacus has not yet emerged.

              Pascal's calculator is a mechanical calculator invented by Blaise
              Pascal in 1642. Pascal was led to develop a calculator by the
              laborious arithmetical calculations required by his father's work
              as the supervisor of taxes in Rouen.

            <h2>The Analytical Engine</h2>
            <p>
              In 1837, Charles Babbage had come up with a new idea: a computer
              that could understand commands and could be programmed much like a
              modern-day computer. He called it the Analytical Engine, and it
              was the first machine ever designed with the idea of programming.

              The tabulating machine was an electromechanical machine designed
              to assist in summarizing information stored on punched cards.
              Invented by Herman Hollerith, the machine was developed to help
              process data for the 1890 U.S. Census.

              A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation describing
              an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape
              according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, it
              is capable of implementing any computer algorithm. Created by Alan
              Turing

              The Atanasoff–Berry computer was the first automatic electronic
              digital computer. Limited by the technology of the day, and
              execution, the device has remained somewhat obscure. The ABC's
              priority is debated among historians of computer technology,
              because it was neither programmable, nor Turing-complete.

              line by IBM consisting of the 701C and 701Cs models based on the
              Intel 486. The 701 is colloquially known as the Butterfly due to
              its sliding keyboard, which was designed by John Karidis. It was
              developed from 1993 and sold from March 1995 until later that year
              and priced between $1,499 and $3,299. The 701 was the most sold
              laptop in 1995 and has received 27 design awards.
